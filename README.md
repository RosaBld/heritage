# Heritage

This project was created during my internship at Alpaga Agency for emaprod immo.

This is a website for their new project, Heritage. 

## The goal 

The goal was to learn how to create a new theme on WordPress by coding and not using the WordPress interface.

### Difficulties

The main difficulty I faced during this project was to work with an old repo given by my intership supervisor and understand how it was conceived and how to work with it.

I needed to understand how they worked on this project and be able to work around it, without breaking it all.

The second main difficulty was to learn how to use the Dependency Manager Composer, as well as a bunch of new frameworks like timber and twig, while learning how WordPress works. Once those steps done, I only needed to conceive the style of the website by using SASS.

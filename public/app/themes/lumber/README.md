# Reach the top with the new Wordpress theme

## Instructions

### Wordpress system

For this theme, it's preferable to use bedrock boilerplate system but it's not a mandatory point (it's more like a nice-to-have).

Clone this repo (https://github.com/roots/bedrock) and configure it.

Follow the procedure you can find in the README.md file on the project's root.

Normally, Timber should be installed within the composer update.

### Humans

At the root of the theme, you can find a humans.txt file, in this file, all members from the Alpaga Team are listed, you have to remove people who don't collaborate directly on the project.
